                <h1>Dress stylish<br> with us</h1>
                <p>You can have anything you want in life<br>if you dress for it.
                    "You can never take too much care over the choice of your shoes. Too many women think
                    that they are
                    unimportant, but the real proof of an elegant woman is what is on her feet."
                    People will stare. Make it worth their while
                    Being well dressed hasn't much to do with having good clothes. Itâ€™s a question of good balance and
                    good common sense.</p>
                <p>Humor is a big part of my style. You have to be willing to fall on your face a bit, to be that
                    fashion roadkill. I know so many people who are die-hard fashion people who are way more educated
                    than I am, but I love fashion. It's so much more important than just material.</p>
